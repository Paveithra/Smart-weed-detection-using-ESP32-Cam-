This project is a **Smart Weed Detection System** using an **ESP32-CAM** and a **YOLOv8/v11 model** to identify and differentiate between crops and weeds in real time. The ESP32-CAM captures images from the field, which are processed using a trained YOLO model (either on a connected device like a Raspberry Pi or a remote server). Based on detection results, the system can highlight weeds and optionally trigger actions like targeted spraying. This solution helps reduce manual labor and herbicide usage, promoting efficient and eco-friendly farming.
